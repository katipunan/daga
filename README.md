daga (aka RubyMotion Application Template or R.A.T)
===================

The goal of this project is to serve as a starting point for the typical RubyMotion business app. Easy things should be easy (or built-in!) and the template should point the way on how to do the hard things.

Project features:

* Display a splash screen on app startup. The splash screen will do nothing other than increment a progress bar by 20% every 1 second. When the progress bar reachers 100%, the main screen is loaded.
* Demonstrate how to use ProMotion and RMQ together. All screens will be ProMotion screens
