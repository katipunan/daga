daga (aka RubyMotion Application Template or R.A.T)
===================

The goal of this project is to serve as a starting point for the typical RubyMotion business app. Easy things should be easy (or built-in!) and the template should point the way on how to do the hard things.

# Project features

* Display a splash screen on app startup. The splash screen will do nothing other than increment a progress bar by 20% every 1 second. When the progress bar reachers 100%, the main screen is loaded.
* Demonstrate how to use ProMotion and RMQ together. All screens will be ProMotion screens

# How to benefit from this project

There are several ways to benefit from this project:

- If you're an experienced or intermediate RubyMotion programmer, you can use this as a starting point for your new project. Stuff like setting up ProMotion and adding a splash screen are already taken care of for you.
- If you're a novice RubyMotion programmer, or just getting started with RMQ and ProMotion, you can follow HOWTO.md to build the project from scratch. You'll learn how to use ProMotion, RMQ, and how to use the two together.
